intuitive data structure

network of nodes 

vertices  edges  edge connection  (uni-directional and Bi-directional)

application of Graphs :

Maps       Social Network( instagram tk )    Delivery Network 

algorithm - shortest path (cyclic)   


GRAPHS :

based of direction  
->directed and undirected

based on weight
->weighted and unweighted

Storing a graph :

Adjacency List (array of array list<edge>  (edge ki list))   
neighbors  directly connected nodes

Adjacency Matrix
Edge List
2D Matrix (Implicit Graph)
